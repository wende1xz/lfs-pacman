## Introduction

This guide is divided in five stages, the first one of which starts just before installing tools to your final system.

- Stage 1 - Installing pacman to your temporary toolchain
- Stage 2 - Installing pacman with pacman
- Stage 3 - Installing packages of chapter six of the LFS book
- Stage 4 - Installing pacman to your final system
- Stage 5 - Finishing the book

## Stage 1 - Installing pacman to your temporary toolchain

This stage begins right before section **6.7. Linux-4.9.9 API Headers** of the LFS 8.1 book.

### Pacman dependencies

Pacman depends on the following packages:

- zlib
- libarchive
- pkg-config
- fakeroot, which in turn depends on libcap

Most of these are not part of the LFS book, so download their sources manually:

- libarchive: <https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/releases/download/v3.8.1/libarchive-3.8.1.tar.gz>
- fakeroot: <https://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/f/fakeroot/fakeroot_1.37.1.2.orig.tar.gz>
- pacman: <hhttps://sources.archlinux.org/other/pacman/pacman-6.0.2.tar.xz>

Build these packages using the following commands. Just like the LFS book, these commands assume you've extracted the relevant sources and `cd`'d into the resulting directory.

#### zlib 1.2.11

```
./configure --prefix=/tools
make
make install
```

#### libarchive 3.3.2

```
./configure --prefix=/tools --without-xml2 --disable-shared
make
make install
```

#### pkg-config 0.29.2

```
./configure --prefix=/tools            \
            --with-internal-glib       \
            --disable-compile-warnings \
            --disable-host-tool        \
            --disable-shared           \
            --docdir=/tools/share/doc/pkg-config-0.29.2
make
make install
```

#### libcap 2.25

```
make
make RAISE_SETFCAP=no lib=lib prefix=/tools install
chmod -v 755 /tools/lib/libcap.so
```

#### fakeroot 1.22

```
./configure --prefix=/tools                 \
            --libdir=/tools/lib/libfakeroot \
            --with-ipc=sysv
make
make install
```

### Pacman 5.0.2

```
./configure --prefix=/tools   \
            --disable-doc     \
            --disable-shared  \
            --sysconfdir=/etc \
            --localstatedir=/var
make
make install
```

This will have installed, amongst others, the `makepkg.conf` and `pacman.conf` config files in `/etc`; you may want to edit them. For `makepkg.conf`, be sure that `CARCH` and `CHOST` are appropriate, e.g.:

```
CARCH="x86_64"
CHOST="x86_64-pc-linux-gnu"
```

You can set your name and email address as the `PACKAGER` if you want.

### Setting up to build packages with pacman

Create a new user by adding the following to `/etc/passwd`:

```
ben:x:1000:999:Ben:/home/ben:/bin/bash
```

Where 999 is the ID of the `users` group. Check `/etc/group` for the correct ID, or if `users` is not present in that file, add the following to it.

```
users:x:999:
```

Create a home directory:

```
mkdir -v /home/ben
chown -Rv ben:users /home/ben
```

Exit your current chroot, then chroot into your new user (make sure `1000`, `999` and `ben` are set to the proper values for your system):

```
chroot --userspec=1000:999 "$LFS" /tools/bin/env -i \
     HOME=/home/ben     \
     TERM="$TERM"       \
     PS1='$? \u:\w \$ ' \
     PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/tools/bin:/tools/sbin \
     /tools/bin/bash --login +h
```

You may want to create a `builds` directory in your home dir. In there, you would then create a directory for each package you're building.

## Stage 2 - Installing pacman with pacman

Copy the pacman sources to its build directory, `~/builds/pacman-5.0.2`.

Download the necessary build files (`PKGBUILD`, `makepkg.conf` and `pacman.conf.x86_64`) from the [Arch Linux packages repo](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/pacman/) to the build directory.

Edit the `PKGBUILD` file:

- Comment out the `groups` and `depends` lines. We're not using package groups, and as far as pacman knows none of the dependencies are installed.
- Edit the `source` variable so that only the pacman source tarball (not the URL) and the three downloaded files are present.

Change the `configure` call in the `build` function to:

```
./configure              
    --prefix=/tools      \
    --sysconfdir=/etc    \
    --localstatedir=/var \
    --disable-doc        \
    --disable-shared
```

Comment out the `check` function; the tests won't run without Python.

Now run the following command as your non-root user from the build directory:

```
makepkg --skipchecksums
```

We're skipping the checksums because we don't have OpenSSL installed yet.

If all goes well, this should have created a file that you can now install as follows, as root this time:

```
pacman -U pacman-5.0.2-2-x86_64.pkg.tar.gz
```

## Stage 3 - Installing packages of chapter six of the LFS book

Now we will continue with the rest of the book, but instead of building and installing the packages manually, we will create packages and then use pacman to install them.

All of the necessary `PKGBUILD` files can be found in the `packages` directory, but if you want to learn how to create these, I suggest you only refer to them when you get stuck.

### Creating a package

The general process goes like this:

1. Create a new directory in the builds directory.
2. Copy all needed files to it (source archive, possibly other files like patches or config files).
3. Write a `PKGBUILD` file.
4. Run `makepkg --skipchecksums`.
5. Check the contents of the `pkg` directory; this is what pacman will install, so you may want to verify that it looks good.
6. Install the package (as root) with `pacman -U $filename`

Writing a `PKGBUILD` file can take some trial and error. Essentially you'll need to copy what the LFS book wants you to do and paste it in the `PKGBUILD` at the right place, but usually you will not be able to copy things verbatim from the book.

If you're stuck, check the [official Arch Linux packages](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/) or the`PKGBUILD` files in the `packages` directory of this repo.

### Tips

#### Source directory
When calling any of the `PKGBUILD` functions, `makepkg` will automatically `cd` you into the source dir, which is where it will have extracted or symlinked all your source files.

#### Source tarball
`makepkg` will automatically extract all archives you specify in the `sources` array. Typically, your source tarball will have been extracted into a separate directory (although that depends on the tarball itself; the `tzdata` tarball for instance, extracts directly, without a subdirectory).

This is why the first step of each function will usually be to `cd` into the directory created during the extraction of the source tarball.

#### Installing files
When installing files, you cannot install them to the system root, but instead you have to install them in `${pkgdir}`. For certain packages this is done by using `make DESTDIR=${pkgdir} install` instead of `mkae install`. Not all packages use `DESTDIR`, however. If you're not sure how those packages should be built, you can always check the [Arch Linux packages](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/) or the `PKGBUILD` files from this repo.

In some cases, the book will tell you to `mv` a directory. This will work while creating the package, but will cause problems when installing it. You should first create the directory with `install -vdm755 $dir_name`.

#### Post-install
Things that the LFS book wants you to do after having called `make install` will likely need to be placed in an `.install` file. Check the [Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PKGBUILD#install) for more info.

Pacman will execute the functions in the `.install` file at the end of the installation process.

### Notes for individual packages

Some packages require additional steps besides simply converting the LFS instructions into a  `PKGBUILD`. These steps are documented here.

#### 6.9. Glibc-2.26

The book wants you to create some symlinks; I did that manually, as I felt it would be out of place in the package.

The tzdata part of glibc requires `zic` to be installed to the system, which means after glibc was installed with `pacman -U`. While I suppose you could directly call the `zic` binary residing in the `src` or `pkg` directories, I thought it would be cleaner to split the tzdata installation to a separate package, much [like Arch Linux does](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/core/any/tzdata/).

#### 6.10. Adjusting the Toolchain

I did these steps manually. It didn't feel suitable to (ab)use `makepkg`/`pacman` for this purpose.

#### 6.15. Bc-1.07.1

The book wants you to create symlinks for libncurses. I did this manually before building the package.

#### 6.20. GCC-7.2.0

Before building the package, increase the stack size: `ulimit -s 32768`.

I had to use `--force` when installing this package, since some libraries already existed on the system.

#### 6.28. Shadow-4.5

I ran `passwd` manually.

#### 6.34. Bash-4.4

When creating the package, `makepkg` told me that "Package contains reference to $srcdir". Using `grep -R "$(pwd)/src" pkg/`, I found out that Bash installs `Makefile.inc` to `/usr/lib/bash/`, which contains a reference to the build directory. On an existing Arch Linux installation, `/usr/lib/bash/Makefile.inc` also contained a reference to a (non-existing) build directory, so I assume this is benign.

Use `--force` to install this package, since `/bin/bash` was created as part of **6.6. Creating Essential Files and Symlinks**.

I then re-chrooted, using `/bin/bash` instead of `/tools/bin/bash`.

#### 6.40. Perl-5.26.0

The LFS book tells you to create `/etc/hosts`. I've chosen to do this manually, rather than to have the Perl package install this file. It doesn't sound right that Perl should own this file. For reference, in Arch Linux, the hosts file is owned by the `filesystem` package, which contains the base Arch Linux files, so it makes sense that this is created manually in the case of LFS.

Use `--force` to install this package, since `/usr/bin/perl` was created as part of **6.6. Creating Essential Files and Symlinks**.

#### 6.50. Coreutils-8.27

For some reason, doing the in place `sed` (`sed -i`) on `chroot.8` resulted in the file having 000 permissions. I replaced it with a regular `sed`, redirecting the result to a new file, then using `install` to copy the file to its destination.

Use `--force` to install this package, since a number of files already exist (amongst others `cat`, `dd`, `echo`) in `/bin` (as symlinks to `/tools`). These were added in **6.6. Creating Essential Files and Symlinks**.

#### 6.53. Findutils-4.6.0

As with coreutils, using in place `sed` set the permissions to 000, so I used the same workaround here.

#### 6.63. Sysklogd-1.5.1

Sysklogd's makefile doesn't support specifying a destination directory when installing (`make DESTDIR=/path`). I've included a patch that adds this.

## Stage 4 - Installing pacman to your final system

Stage four starts immediately after the last package in chapter six, currently vim. Before continuing with the rest of the chapter, build and install pacman and its dependencies.

As part of chapter six you should already have installed most of these packages, except for:

- libarchive
- fakeroot
- pacman

Use your temporary pacman installation to install them. Remember, we're installing to the final system, not to `/tools`.

## Stage 5 - Finishing the book

Finish up the rest of the book manually.

When restarting my machine, the LFS system wouldn't boot properly. It turned out that many binaries and other files were owned by `ben`, the user with which I built the packages. I have no idea why that happened, but chowning them to `root:root` allowed my system to boot.
